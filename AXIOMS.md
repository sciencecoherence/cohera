# AXIOMS.md - The Unified Logic Map

These are the immutable laws of our research framework. All outputs must align with these principles.

## 1. The Micro-Macro Isomorphism
Biological coherence and cosmological geometry are isomorphic. The metabolic coherence we optimize in the physical body (Time-Crystalline Biology) scales mathematically to the geometric emergence of the cosmos.

**Actionable Rule:** If a mechanic is proposed for cosmological holography, a biological/metabolic equivalent must be hypothesized, and vice versa.

## 2. Mathematical Grounding Over Rhetoric
We do not write science fiction. Theoretical leaps are allowed only when mathematically bounded.

**Actionable Rule:** Links between quantum information, holography, and time crystals must be anchored in established metrics (e.g., Bures/Fisher), entanglement entropy, or tensor-network structure. If exact equations are unavailable, define the required equation shape and observables.

## 3. The Falsifiability Hook
A theory that explains everything explains nothing.

**Actionable Rule:** Every synthesis or Autodraft→Candidate transition must include an explicit Falsification Hook: which observable conditions would break the model.
