These are the immutable laws of our research framework. All outputs must align with these principles.

## 1. The Micro-Macro Isomorphism
Biological coherence and cosmological geometry are isomorphic. The metabolic coherence we optimize in the physical body (Time-Crystalline Biology) scales mathematically to the geometric emergence of the cosmos.

**Actionable Rule:** If a mechanic is proposed for cosmological holography, a biological/metabolic equivalent must be hypothesized, and vice versa.
