# BTC Playbook v1 (Jalapablo-Adapted)

## 1) Core Risk Rules (non-negotiable)
- Risk per trade: **1% max**
- Daily max loss: **2%**
- Weekly max loss: **5%** (stop trading for the week)
- No revenge trades
- If setup is unclear: **no trade**

## 2) Timeframes
- **HTF Bias:** Weekly + Daily
- **Execution:** 4H (primary), 1H (refinement only)

## 3) Bias Model (before any entry)
Mark these every day:
1. Price vs **200W SMA** (regime context)
2. Major support/resistance zones
3. Liquidity pools (equal highs/lows, obvious stops)
4. Market condition:
   - Trend
   - Range
   - Breakdown/recovery

Trade with HTF bias unless a very clear range fade setup appears.

## 4) Setup A — Absorb → Raid → Reclaim (Long)
Use near key support/liquidity-low areas.

Checklist:
- [ ] Price sweeps below obvious low (raid)
- [ ] Fast reclaim back above level
- [ ] Volume expansion on reclaim (relative increase)
- [ ] 4H closes back above trigger zone
- [ ] Stop can be placed below sweep low

Entry: reclaim close or retest  
Stop: below sweep low  
TP1: prior range mid / local resistance  
TP2: major HTF liquidity above  
Minimum RR: **2R**

## 5) Setup B — Distribution → Breakdown Retest (Short)
Use in weak/bear contexts.

Checklist:
- [ ] Range top failures / weak bounces
- [ ] Breakdown below key support
- [ ] Retest fails (bearish rejection candle)
- [ ] Volume confirms selling pressure
- [ ] Stop can be placed above failed retest

Entry: failed retest close  
Stop: above failed retest high  
TP1: nearest liquidity low  
TP2: next HTF support  
Minimum RR: **2R**

## 6) Position Sizing Formula
`Position size = (Account × Risk%) / (Entry - Stop)`

Example:  
Account $2,000, risk 1% ($20), stop distance $500  
Size = 20/500 = **0.04 BTC** (or equivalent contract size)

## 7) Trade Journal (required)
- Date/time
- Setup type (A/B)
- Bias (bull/range/bear)

- Mistake? (yes/no)
- Screenshot before + after

After every 20 trades:

- Avg win R
- Avg loss R

- Which setup performs better

## 8) Weekly Routine
- **Sunday:** mark HTF levels + scenarios
- **Daily (15 min):** update bias + alerts
- **After trade:** journal immediately
- **Friday:** review metrics and mistakes

## 9) Kill Switch Conditions
Stop trading 48h if:
- 3 losses in a row
- You moved stop impulsively
- You broke a risk rule once
- You took FOMO trade outside checklist
