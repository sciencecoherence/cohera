# Website Rebuild Rules (No Regression)

1. Do not remove working pages/links that are already live.
2. Keep stable URLs for:
   - /cohera/research/index.html
   - /cohera/publications/index.html
   - /cohera/publications/pdf/index.html
   - /cohera/research/findings-latest.html
3. Publications must contain only final reader-ready outputs.
4. Research must show pipeline progress and intermediate steps.
5. Every redesign change must preserve existing working behavior first, then improve style/accessibility.
6. Prefer additive refactors and clear diffs over destructive rewrites.
