## Priority candidates

- **Automata Learning with an Incomplete but Inductive Teacher**
  - Topic: digital twins uncertainty
  - Claim to test: Active automata learning (AAL) under a Minimally Adequate Teacher (MAT) has been successfully used to infer a regular language through membership and equivalence queries. This…

- **Criticality Beyond Nonanalyticity: Intrinsic Microcanonical Signatures of Phase Transitions**
  - Topic: self-organization nonequilibrium thermodynamics
  - Claim to test: Phase transitions are conventionally defined by nonanalyticities of thermodynamic potentials in the thermodynamic limit. In this Letter, we show that the singularity is not the…

- **Observation of sequential quantum oscillations induced by mini-Landau bands in a three-dimensional Dirac semiconductor**
  - Topic: self-organization nonequilibrium thermodynamics
  - Claim to test: Quantum oscillations, the oscillatory behavior of electrical and thermodynamic properties, are typically observed in metals and vanish in the quantum limit under strong magnetic…

- **A One-Dimensional Reduction Method for Calculating Thermal Expansion in Solids: Application to Orthorhombic Systems**
  - Topic: self-organization nonequilibrium thermodynamics
  - Claim to test: Anisotropic thermal expansion plays a critical role in the performance and reliability of functional materials, yet its theoretical description remains limited. Here, a…

- **Body-Reservoir Governance in Repeated Games: Embodied Decision-Making, Dynamic Sentinel Adaptation, and Complexity-Regularized Optimization**
  - Topic: self-organization nonequilibrium thermodynamics
  - Claim to test: Standard game theory explains cooperation in repeated games through conditional strategies such as Tit-for-Tat (TfT), but these require continuous computation that imposes…
