- **Circumventing the CAP Theorem with Open Atomic Ethernet**
  - Topic: chaos control biological systems
  - Claim to test: The CAP theorem is routinely treated as a systems law: under network partition, a replicated service must sacrifice either consistency or availability. The theorem is correct…
  - Citation: Paul Borrill (2026-02-24). Circumventing the CAP Theorem with Open Atomic Ethernet. arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21182v1
- **Memory Undone: Between Knowing and Not Knowing in Data Systems**
  - Topic: metabolic health systems biology
  - Claim to test: Machine learning and data systems increasingly function as infrastructures of memory: they ingest, store, and operationalize traces of personal, political, and cultural life. Yet…
