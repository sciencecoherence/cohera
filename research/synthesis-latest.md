## Priority candidates

- **cyclinbayes: Bayesian Causal Discovery with Linear Non-Gaussian Directed Acyclic and Cyclic Graphical Models**
  - Topic: digital twins uncertainty
  - Claim to test: We introduce cyclinbayes, an open-source R package for discovering linear causal relationships with both acyclic and cyclic structures. The package employs scalable Bayesian…

- **Not Just How Much, But Where: Decomposing Epistemic Uncertainty into Per-Class Contributions**
  - Topic: digital twins uncertainty
  - Claim to test: In safety-critical classification, the cost of failure is often asymmetric, yet Bayesian deep learning summarises epistemic uncertainty with a single scalar, mutual information…

- **SELAUR: Self Evolving LLM Agent via Uncertainty-aware Rewards**
  - Topic: digital twins uncertainty
  - Claim to test: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as multi-step decision-making agents, where effective reward design is essential for guiding learning. Although recent work…

- **Geometry- and inertia-limited chaotic growth in classical many-body systems**
  - Topic: self-organization nonequilibrium thermodynamics
  - Claim to test: Chaotic instability in many-body systems is commonly quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent, yet general constraints on its magnitude in classical interacting systems remain…

- **Controlling inertial active Brownian motion via stochastic resetting**
  - Topic: self-organization nonequilibrium thermodynamics
  - Claim to test: Inertia is intrinsic to many living and synthetic active systems, from animals and robotic agents to colloidal swimmers, and it strongly shapes transport. Many such systems employ…

- **SOM-VQ: Topology-Aware Tokenization for Interactive Generative Models**
  - Topic: self-organization nonequilibrium thermodynamics
  - Claim to test: Vector-quantized representations enable powerful discrete generative models but lack semantic structure in token space, limiting interpretable human control. We introduce SOM-VQ,…
