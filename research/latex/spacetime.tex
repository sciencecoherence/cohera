\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{} 
For more than a century, physics has treated spacetime as the fundamental
arena of existence---a geometric manifold that bends, stretches, and
carries the weight of matter and energy. Yet this picture mistakes a
useful description for an ontological truth. Spacetime is not a
substance; it is an appearance. Beneath every observable phenomenon lies
a continuously updating informational substrate whose intrinsic
periodicity organizes all physical structure. The only primitive
quantity is the coherence density $C(x)$, which encodes the local degree
of phase order within this substrate. Regions where $C$ remains stable
appear to us as ``locations,'' and persistence across update cycles
appears as ``duration,'' but these interpretations arise from human
compression of relational patterns rather than from any underlying
geometry. Motion is not evolution through space, nor change through
time, but reconfiguration of coherence across successive cycles of the
substrate's internal rhythm. Gravity itself is not curvature of a
manifold but the natural flow toward higher coherence, expressed
dynamically by 
\[
    a_\mu = -\,\kappa\,\nabla_\mu C(x),
\]
indicating that physical systems accelerate along coherence gradients
because such directions maximize informational stability within the
substrate. The planets do not trace geodesics in a curved spacetime;
they follow the smoothest path through coherence structure. Stars form
as coherence condenses; gravitational wells mark coherence extremes; and
black holes represent informational attractors rather than geometric
singularities. What we call spacetime is therefore a macroscopic
interpretation of relational order---a user interface rendered by the
brain to track the unfolding of coherence across cycles of an
infinitely deeper process. Reality is not a stage but a symphony of
coherence, and spacetime is merely the pattern we perceive when we
listen from within the music.
