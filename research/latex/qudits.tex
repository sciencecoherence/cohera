\textbf{Abstract.} \\
In the framework of Topological and Categorical Quantum Systems (TCQS), the \emph{qudit} arises as a fundamental generalization of the qubit, expanding the basic unit of quantum information from a binary to a $d$-dimensional state space. This shift is not merely quantitative but structural: it suggests a richer algebraic topology underlying the universe’s informational substrate.

\section*{Qudits and Dimensional Encoding}
A qubit resides in a two-dimensional Hilbert space spanned by $\{\ket{0}, \ket{1}\}$, whereas a qudit extends this basis to $\{\ket{0}, \ket{1}, \dots, \ket{d-1}\}$. Its state is
\[
\ket{\psi} = \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \alpha_i \ket{i}, \quad \text{with } \sum_i |\alpha_i|^2 = 1.
\]
In TCQS, such higher-dimensional structures correspond to morphisms between categorical objects, enabling computation to be described not as bitwise logic but as topological evolution in a braided or tensor network space. Each qudit can represent a node in a higher-order quantum code that preserves information through topological invariants.

\section*{Why It Matters}
The move from qubits to qudits mirrors the progression from discrete binary codes to universal symbolic grammars. If the “elementary table” of the universe—the complete set of matter, charge, and interaction types—is itself a \emph{coding system}, then qudits provide a natural medium for modeling it. A $d$-level logic corresponds to the universe’s intrinsic symmetries, suggesting that computation and physical law are two projections of the same categorical structure.

In this view, the TCQS framework positions qudits as the algebraic atoms of existence: carriers of both informational and geometric meaning. To compute the universe is to manipulate the morphisms of these quditic codes—where energy, matter, and symmetry emerge as informational patterns within a universal quantum compiler.
