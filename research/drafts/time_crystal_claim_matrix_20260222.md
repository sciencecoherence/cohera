# Time-Crystal Claim Matrix (2026-02-22)

## Scope
Structured extraction from two DOI-verified papers to support model progression.

## Source A (biosystem)
- DOI: 10.1063/5.0130618
- Title: Polyatomic time crystals of the brain neuron extracted microtubule are projected like a hologram meters away
- Journal: Journal of Applied Physics (2022)

### Claim → Evidence → Falsification
1. **Claim:** Polyatomic (multi-clock) time-crystal behavior appears in neuron-extracted microtubule nanowires.
   - **Evidence (paper-level, abstract):** reports multiple spontaneous time-symmetry-breaking events and distinct clocks.
   - **Falsification test:** independent labs reproduce multi-clock spectra under matched prep/protocol and quantify clock persistence statistics.

2. **Claim:** Effects are observed far below excitation frequency scales.
   - **Evidence:** abstract states search region ~10^3 orders lower than excitation region.
   - **Falsification test:** frequency-domain replication with blinded analysis and instrument control baselines.

3. **Claim:** Projection/hologram-like meter-range behavior.
   - **Evidence:** claimed in title/abstract framing.
   - **Falsification test:** shielded setup, distance sweep, null controls, antenna/environmental artifact rejection.

**Current confidence:** medium (citation verified, extraordinary claim requires replication depth).

## Source B (cosmology)
- DOI: 10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08622-3
- Title: Cosmological time crystals from Einstein-cubic gravities
- Journal: The European Physical Journal C (2020)

### Claim → Equation-level object → Falsification
1. **Claim:** FLRW can realize classical time-crystal dynamics with suitable Riemann-cubic invariants.
   - **Evidence:** model construction in modified gravity; spontaneous time-reflection symmetry breaking between vacua with same scale factor a and opposite a-dot.
   - **Falsification test:** consistency checks against stability/causality constraints and observational cosmology bounds.

2. **Claim:** Tunneling between opposite-velocity vacua provides bounce mechanism for positive energy density.
   - **Evidence:** explicit statement in abstract and model interpretation.
   - **Falsification test:** parameter-space scan to ensure no hidden ghosts/instabilities in physically admissible regions.

3. **Claim:** Cyclic universe solutions can be built for suitable matter tensors; analogous behavior in massive gravity.
   - **Evidence:** model-level constructions.
   - **Falsification test:** confront with CMB/BAO/SN constraints and perturbation growth consistency.

**Current confidence:** medium-high (solid theoretical literature branch; still model-dependent, non-consensus as final cosmology).

## Integration rules for model progression
1. Tag every downstream statement with source + confidence + testability.
2. Keep biosystem branch in “replication-required” lane.
3. Keep cosmology branch in “theory-active” lane with explicit parameter constraints.
4. Promote to high confidence only after independent multi-source corroboration.
