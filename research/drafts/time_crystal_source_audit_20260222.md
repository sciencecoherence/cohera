# Time-Crystal Source Audit (2026-02-22)

Goal: verify claims provided from Grok and integrate validated learnings into the research pipeline.

## Input claims to verify
1. 2022 AIP paper: brain-neuron microtubules form polyatomic time crystals and project holograms meters away.
2. 2020 EPJC paper: FLRW universe as cosmological time crystal via symmetry breaking in modified gravity.

## Verification outcome (updated with exact citations)

### A) 2020 EPJC cosmological time-crystal paper — VERIFIED
**Exact citation confirmed (Crossref DOI lookup):**
- Feng, X.-H.; Wu, D.-J.; Liu, Y.-X.; Zhao, L.
- *Cosmological time crystals from Einstein-cubic gravities*
- **The European Physical Journal C** 80(11):1079 (2020)
- DOI: `10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08622-3`
- Link: https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08622-3

What we learn for the model:
- FLRW dynamics can host time-crystal-like behavior in modified gravity via cubic invariants.
- Spontaneous time-reflection / time-translation symmetry-breaking interpretations are operationally used for cyclic/bounce behavior.
- Strong theoretical support for keeping the cosmological time-crystal branch active.

Confidence: **medium-high** (direct bibliographic verification; still theoretical/model-dependent).

### B) 2022 AIP microtubule polyatomic time-crystal paper — VERIFIED (bibliography), CLAIM STRENGTH STILL UNDER REVIEW
**Exact citation confirmed (Crossref DOI lookup):**
- Saxena, K.; Singh, P.; Sarkar, J.; Sahoo, P.; Ghosh, S.; Krishnananda, S. D.; Bandyopadhyay, A.
- *Polyatomic time crystals of the brain neuron extracted microtubule are projected like a hologram meters away*
- **Journal of Applied Physics** 132(19), 194401 (2022)
- DOI: `10.1063/5.0130618`
- Link: https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0130618

What we learn for the model:
- The publication exists and directly supports the stated hypothesis direction (polyatomic time-crystal framing in neuron-extracted microtubules).
- However, because this is a high-impact biophysical claim, we still need replication depth and independent corroboration before promoting to high-confidence model axioms.

Confidence: **medium (citation verified, replication status pending)**.

## Integration into model pipeline
- Keep cosmological time-crystal branch as an active theoretical line.
- Add explicit confidence labeling on all pages: low/medium/high + reason.
- Distinguish two validation layers:
  1. **Bibliographic verification** (exists + exact DOI) ✅
  2. **Reproducibility confidence** (independent confirmations) ⏳
- Add a dedicated "Source audit" subsection to future findings reports.

## Next actions
1. Extract full technical claims/equations from both papers into structured notes.
2. Build a falsification checklist for each key claim (especially biosystem branch).
3. Link these audited sources into Cosmos v5+ draft with explicit confidence tags per statement.
