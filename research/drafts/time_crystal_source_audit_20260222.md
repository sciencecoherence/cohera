# Time-Crystal Source Audit (2026-02-22)

Goal: verify claims provided from Grok and integrate validated learnings into the research pipeline.

## Input claims to verify
1. 2022 AIP paper: brain-neuron microtubules form polyatomic time crystals and project holograms meters away.
2. 2020 EPJC paper: FLRW universe as cosmological time crystal via symmetry breaking in modified gravity.

## Verification outcome

### A) Cosmological time-crystal literature — FOUND (supportive, model-level)
Verified via arXiv API (titles/abstracts):
- `1801.07970` — *Cosmological Time Crystal: Cyclic Universe with a small Λ in a toy model approach*
- `1802.03693` — *Stable Cosmic Time Crystals*
- `1807.01720` — *Cosmological Time Crystals From Einstein-Cubic Gravities*

What we learned:
- Time-crystal constructions are used as cyclic/bounce cosmology mechanisms in FRW/FLRW-like settings.
- Several papers explicitly discuss spontaneous time-reflection symmetry breaking and cyclic scale-factor dynamics.
- Stability is a central bottleneck (gradient instability / sound-speed issues), and some works propose stable variants.

Confidence: **medium** (theoretical literature exists, but model-dependent and not consensus cosmology).

### B) Microtubule polyatomic time-crystal + meter-scale hologram claim — NOT VERIFIED
Current search pass did not confirm a matching publication with that exact claim strength.

What we learned:
- Microtubule/neuron literature exists broadly, but this specific strong claim needs exact citation (DOI/title/authors) and replication evidence.
- Treat as **unverified/speculative** until direct source is located and independently checked.

Confidence: **low** (pending exact citation and reproducibility evidence).

## Integration into model pipeline
- Keep cosmological time-crystal branch as active theoretical line.
- Add explicit confidence labeling on all pages: low/medium/high + reason.
- Require a strict citation rule before promoting biosystem claims to "finding" status.
- Add a dedicated "Source audit" subsection to future findings reports.

## Next actions
1. Resolve exact EPJC bibliographic mapping for 2020 reference (journal issue/DOI).
2. Retrieve exact bibliographic data for the claimed 2022 AIP microtubule paper.
3. Publish a public audit note in `site/publications/` with confidence and falsification checklist.
