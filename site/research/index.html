                    <div class="card-body">We introduce cyclinbayes, an open-source R package for discovering linear causal relationships with both acyclic and cyclic structures. The package employs scalable Bayesian approaches with spike-and-slab priors to learn directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and directed cyclic graphs (DCGs) under non-Gaussian noise. A central feature of cyclinbayes is comprehensive uncertainty quantification, including posterior edge inclusion probabilities, posterior probabilities of network motifs, and posterior probabilities over entire graph structures.

                    <div class="card-body">In safety-critical classification, the cost of failure is often asymmetric, yet Bayesian deep learning summarises epistemic uncertainty with a single scalar, mutual information (MI), that cannot distinguish whether a model&#x27;s ignorance involves a benign or safety-critical class. We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=σ_k^{2}/(2μ_k)$, with $μ_k{=}\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $σ_k^2{=}\mathrm{Var}[p_k]$ across posterior samples. The decomposition follows from a second-order Taylor expansion of the entropy; the $1/μ_k$ weighting corrects boundary suppression and makes $C_k$ comparable across…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21160v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

                    <div class="card-body">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as multi-step decision-making agents, where effective reward design is essential for guiding learning. Although recent work explores various forms of reward shaping and step-level credit assignment, a key signal remains largely overlooked: the intrinsic uncertainty of LLMs. Uncertainty reflects model confidence, reveals where exploration is needed, and offers valuable learning cues even in failed trajectories.

                    <div class="card-body">Chaotic instability in many-body systems is commonly quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent, yet general constraints on its magnitude in classical interacting systems remain poorly understood. Here we establish explicit, Hamiltonian-specific upper bounds on the largest Lyapunov exponent for classical many-body systems with local interactions. These bounds arise from instantaneous stability constraints on the Hamiltonian flow and are expressed in terms of inertial scales and the curvature of the interaction potential. We show that they naturally separate into two qualitatively distinct…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21149v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

Many such systems employ intermittent restart protocols to regulate exploration. Stochastic resetting provides a theoretical framework for these strategies and a route to control nonequilibrium steady states, yet the role of inertia in reset-controlled active dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we study an inertial active Brownian particle subject to complete stochastic resetting of position, velocity, and orientation in two…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21134v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

We introduce SOM-VQ, a tokenization method that combines vector quantization with Self-Organizing Maps to learn discrete codebooks with explicit low-dimensional topology. Unlike standard VQ-VAE, SOM-VQ uses topology-aware updates that preserve neighborhood structure: nearby tokens on a learned grid correspond to semantically similar states, enabling direct geometric manipulation of the latent space.

Thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in nanopores differ from the properties of the same fluids in bulk. Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used for modeling thermodynamics of confined fluids. However, it is rarely used for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties. Here we use a rather simple DFT model for argon based on the Percus-Yevick equation, and showed that with…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21111v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

By exploiting the structure of the constraints, we show that both a priori and a posteriori distribution-free probabilistic robustness certificates for a possibly sub-optimal solution to the resulting data-driven optimization problem can be obtained with minimal computational effort.

Identification of regions of interest (ROIs) is central to scientific imaging, as it enables isolation and quantitative analysis of specific structural features within complex datasets. In practice, however, ROIs are typically derived indirectly through full structure segmentation followed by post hoc analysis.

By combining full counting statistics with newly developed non-Markovian master equation approaches, we introduce an effective master equation whose solution can be used to generate arbitrary moments of the heat statistics for any number of reservoirs. This theory applies equally to fermionic and bosonic systems, holds at arbitrarily strong coupling, and resolves out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics determined by the system&#x27;s initial state.

However, challenges persist in image-to-video synthesis, particularly in human video generation, where inferring view-consistent, motion-dependent clothing wrinkles from a single image remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control.

The theorem is correct within its standard asynchronous network model, but operational practice depends on where partition-like phenomena become observable and on how lower layers discard or preserve semantic information about message fate.
