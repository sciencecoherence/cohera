                    <div class="card-body">Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables high resolution, three-dimensional reconstruction of biological structures, including membranes and membrane proteins. Identification of regions of interest (ROIs) is central to scientific imaging, as it enables isolation and quantitative analysis of specific structural features within complex datasets. In practice, however, ROIs are typically derived indirectly through full structure segmentation followed by post hoc analysis. This limitation is especially apparent for continuous and geometrically complex structures such as membranes, which are…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21195v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

By combining full counting statistics with newly developed non-Markovian master equation approaches, we introduce an effective master equation whose solution can be used to generate arbitrary moments of the heat statistics for any number of reservoirs. This theory applies equally to fermionic and bosonic systems, holds at arbitrarily strong coupling, and resolves out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics determined by the system&#x27;s initial state.

                    <div class="card-body">Recent diffusion methods have made significant progress in generating videos from single images due to their powerful visual generation capabilities. However, challenges persist in image-to-video synthesis, particularly in human video generation, where inferring view-consistent, motion-dependent clothing wrinkles from a single image remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control.

                    <div class="card-body">Bengali, despite being one of the most widely spoken languages globally, remains underrepresented in long form speech technology, particularly in systems addressing transcription and speaker attribution. We present frameworks for long form Bengali speech intelligence that address automatic speech recognition using a Whisper Medium based model and speaker diarization using a finetuned segmentation model. The ASR pipeline incorporates vocal separation, voice activity detection, and a gap aware windowing strategy to construct context preserving segments for stable decoding.

                    <div class="card-body">The CAP theorem is routinely treated as a systems law: under network partition, a replicated service must sacrifice either consistency or availability. The theorem is correct within its standard asynchronous network model, but operational practice depends on where partition-like phenomena become observable and on how lower layers discard or preserve semantic information about message fate. This paper argues that Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) shifts the engineering regime in which CAP tradeoffs become application-visible by (i) replacing fire-and-forget link semantics with bounded-time bilateral…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21182v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

                    <div class="card-body">Machine learning and data systems increasingly function as infrastructures of memory: they ingest, store, and operationalize traces of personal, political, and cultural life. Yet contemporary governance demands credible forms of forgetting, from GDPR-backed deletion to harm-mitigation and the removal of manipulative content, while technical infrastructures are optimized to retain, replicate, and reuse. This work argues that &quot;forgetting&quot; in computational systems cannot be reduced to a single operation (e.g., record deletion) and should instead be treated as a sociotechnical practice with…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21180v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

Conventional models often act as opaque &#x27;&#x27;black boxes&#x27;&#x27; and fail to quantify the complex, irregular tumor boundaries that characterize malignant growth. To address these challenges, we present XMorph, an explainable and computationally efficient framework for fine-grained classification of three prominent brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors.

However, PPP ignores policy risk. We show that this is consequential, leading to an overstatement of expected utility and an understatement of portfolio risk. We develop Bayesian Parametric Portfolio Policies (BPPP), which place a prior on policy coefficients thereby correcting the decision rule. We derive a general result showing that the utility gap between PPP and BPPP is strictly…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21173v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST&#x27;s efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR.

                    <div class="card-body">Test-time training (TTT) with KV binding as sequence modeling layer is commonly interpreted as a form of online meta-learning that memorizes a key-value mapping at test time. However, our analysis reveals multiple phenomena that contradict this memorization-based interpretation. Motivated by these findings, we revisit the formulation of TTT and show that a broad class of TTT architectures can be expressed as a form of learned linear attention operator.

                    <div class="card-body">Visual reinforcement learning is appealing for robotics but expensive -- off-policy methods are sample-efficient yet slow; on-policy methods parallelize well but waste samples. Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate training dynamics and introduce substantial storage and encoding overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Squint, a visual Soft Actor Critic method that achieves faster wall-clock training…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21203v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

However, most existing methods for correlation analysis fail to simultaneously capture the time-varying and covariate-dependent effects.
