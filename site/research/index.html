                    <div class="card-body">For the $t$-$J$ model, variational wave functions can generally be constructed based on an accurate description of antiferromagnetism (AFM) at half-filling and an exact phase-string sign structure under doping. The single-hole-doped and two-hole-doped states, as determined by variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulations, display sharply contrasting behaviors. The single-hole state constitutes a ``cat state&#x27;&#x27; that resonates strongly between a quasiparticle component and a local loop-current component, with approximately equal weights. In the ground state, the quasiparticle spectral weight…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21206v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

                    <div class="card-body">RR Lyrae stars are a common, dependable Population II distance indicator, and provide an independent tracer of early star formation. Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST&#x27;s efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data.

                    <div class="card-body">Test-time training (TTT) with KV binding as sequence modeling layer is commonly interpreted as a form of online meta-learning that memorizes a key-value mapping at test time. However, our analysis reveals multiple phenomena that contradict this memorization-based interpretation. Motivated by these findings, we revisit the formulation of TTT and show that a broad class of TTT architectures can be expressed as a form of learned linear attention operator. Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21204v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

                    <div class="card-body">Visual reinforcement learning is appealing for robotics but expensive -- off-policy methods are sample-efficient yet slow; on-policy methods parallelize well but waste samples. Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate training dynamics and introduce substantial storage and encoding overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Squint, a visual Soft Actor Critic method that achieves faster wall-clock training…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21203v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

                    <div class="card-body">In multivariate longitudinal studies, associations between outcomes often exhibit time-varying and individual level heterogeneity, motivating the modeling of correlations as an explicit function of time and covariates. However, most existing methods for correlation analysis fail to simultaneously capture the time-varying and covariate-dependent effects. We propose a Time-Varying and Covariate-Dependent (TiVAC) correlation model that jointly allows covariate effects on correlation to change flexibly and smoothly across time. TiVAC employs a bivariate Gaussian model where the covariate-…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21200v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

We concentrate on interacting Kitaev-like Floquet chains (or equivalently transverse field Ising circuits) and introduce Floquet Green&#x27;s-function-based topological invariants for the corresponding symmetry class BDI.

                    <div class="card-body">Embodied LLMs endow robots with high-level task reasoning, but they cannot reflect on what went wrong or why, turning deployment into a sequence of independent trials where mistakes repeat rather than accumulate into experience. Drawing upon human reflective practitioners, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, which integrates two modes of reflection: \textit{reflection-in-action}, where the agent uses test-time scaling to generate and score multiple candidate actions using internal reflections before execution; and \textit{reflection-on-action}, which uses test-time training to update…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21198v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

                    <div class="card-body">Efficiently processing long sequences with Transformer models usually requires splitting the computations across accelerators via context parallelism. The dominant approaches in this family of methods, such as Ring Attention or DeepSpeed Ulysses, enable scaling over the context dimension but do not focus on memory efficiency, which limits the sequence lengths they can support. More advanced techniques, such as Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer or activation offloading, can further extend the possible context length at the cost of training throughput.
