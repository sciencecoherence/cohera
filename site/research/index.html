Here we establish explicit, Hamiltonian-specific upper bounds on the largest Lyapunov exponent for classical many-body systems with local interactions. These bounds arise from instantaneous stability constraints on the Hamiltonian flow and are expressed in terms of inertial scales and the curvature of the interaction potential. We show that they naturally separate into two qualitatively distinct…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21149v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

                    <div class="card-body">Inertia is intrinsic to many living and synthetic active systems, from animals and robotic agents to colloidal swimmers, and it strongly shapes transport. Many such systems employ intermittent restart protocols to regulate exploration. Stochastic resetting provides a theoretical framework for these strategies and a route to control nonequilibrium steady states, yet the role of inertia in reset-controlled active dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we study an inertial active Brownian particle subject to complete stochastic resetting of position, velocity, and orientation in two…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21134v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

                    <div class="card-body">Vector-quantized representations enable powerful discrete generative models but lack semantic structure in token space, limiting interpretable human control. We introduce SOM-VQ, a tokenization method that combines vector quantization with Self-Organizing Maps to learn discrete codebooks with explicit low-dimensional topology. Unlike standard VQ-VAE, SOM-VQ uses topology-aware updates that preserve neighborhood structure: nearby tokens on a learned grid correspond to semantically similar states, enabling direct geometric manipulation of the latent space. We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21133v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

                    <div class="card-body">Fluids in nanopores are of importance for many engineering applications, including energy storage in supercapacitors, hydrocarbons recovery from unconventional sources, or water desalination. Thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in nanopores differ from the properties of the same fluids in bulk. Density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used for modeling thermodynamics of confined fluids. However, it is rarely used for calculations of derivative thermodynamic properties. Here we use a rather simple DFT model for argon based on the Percus-Yevick equation, and showed that with…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21111v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

By exploiting the structure of the constraints, we show that both a priori and a posteriori distribution-free probabilistic robustness certificates for a possibly sub-optimal solution to the resulting data-driven optimization problem can be obtained with minimal computational effort.

Identification of regions of interest (ROIs) is central to scientific imaging, as it enables isolation and quantitative analysis of specific structural features within complex datasets. In practice, however, ROIs are typically derived indirectly through full structure segmentation followed by post hoc analysis. This limitation is especially apparent for continuous and geometrically complex structures such as membranes, which are…<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21195v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primary source ↗</a></p></div>

By combining full counting statistics with newly developed non-Markovian master equation approaches, we introduce an effective master equation whose solution can be used to generate arbitrary moments of the heat statistics for any number of reservoirs. This theory applies equally to fermionic and bosonic systems, holds at arbitrarily strong coupling, and resolves out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics determined by the system&#x27;s initial state.

However, challenges persist in image-to-video synthesis, particularly in human video generation, where inferring view-consistent, motion-dependent clothing wrinkles from a single image remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control.
