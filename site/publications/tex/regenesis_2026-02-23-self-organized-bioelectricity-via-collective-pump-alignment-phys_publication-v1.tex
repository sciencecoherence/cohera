Expand with validated claims and citation links before promotion. Key findings (draft) Pending manual extraction. Evidence \& citations TODO: add primary references. Hypotheses TODO: explicitly label speculative claims. Next queries What is the smallest testable claim from this source?

\section{Evidence and Claims}
Evidence extraction pending deeper review.

\section{Discussion}
Discussion to be expanded in subsequent research cycles.

\section{Validation Hooks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Verify central claims against primary paper and DOI source.
\item Separate measured evidence from interpretation in final revision.
\item Keep confidence conservative until corroboration is explicit.
\end{itemize}
