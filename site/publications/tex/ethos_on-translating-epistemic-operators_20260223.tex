Auto summary (preview-based) . Awareness-Based Indistinguishability Logic (henceforth, AIL) is an extension of Epistemic Logic by introducing the notion of awareness, distinguishing explicit knowledge from implicit knowledge. In this framework, each of these notions is represented by a modal operator. On the other hand, HMS models, developed in the economics literature, also provide a formalization of those notions. Nevertheless, the behavior of the epistemic operators in AIL within HMS models has yet to be explored. In this paper, we define a transformation of an AIL model into an HMS model and then prove that a translation between the fragments of the language of AIL preserves truth under this transformation. As a result, we clarify the semantic role of an epistemic operator in AIL, which is induced by awareness and is essential to defining explicit knowledge, within HMS models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the differences in the implicit knowledge captured by AIL and HMS models. This work lays the groundwork for a comparative analysis between the model classes. Key findings (auto-extracted) Primary topic appears to center on: translating, epistemic, operators, logic. Source was auto-indexed and text-previewed for rapid triage. Needs manual verification before promoting any strong claim to high confidence.

\subsection*{Validation checklist}
\begin{itemize}
\item Verify central claims against the original source material.
\item Attach DOI/citation identifiers where available.
\item Promote confidence only after corroboration.
