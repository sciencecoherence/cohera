\begin{abstract}
This paper consolidates the Cosmos v5 formal layer into a publishable baseline. We define a computable coherence functional, introduce an operator-norm compatibility criterion for projected stability, and outline a geometry reconstruction protocol from state distinguishability. The focus is methodological clarity: each equation maps to an observable quantity and each interpretive claim carries an explicit falsification path.

\section{Introduction}
Cosmos v5 studies how coherent operator structure can be tracked across projected sectors without collapsing interpretability into heuristic narrative. Earlier drafts mixed useful equations with pipeline metadata and implementation notes. This version removes non-academic artifacts and presents the formal core in a clean sequence: coherence functional, stability threshold, and geometry protocol.

\section{Coherence Functional}
Let $\rho_{\mathrm{loc}}$ be the localized density operator in a fixed basis. We define off-diagonal coherence by
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}(\rho_{\mathrm{loc}})=\sum_{i\neq j}\left|\rho_{ij}\right|.
\end{equation}
Selection dynamics are controlled by an energy--coherence tradeoff
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_n = E_n - \kappa\,\mathcal{C}_n,
\end{equation}
where $\kappa>0$ weights coherence preservation against energetic cost over recurrence windows.

\section{Stability Threshold}
Let $\Pi$ denote the projection operator onto the selected coherent sector and $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ the local flow operator. Compatibility mismatch is
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon = \left\|\Pi\mathcal{F} - \mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{loc}}\Pi\right\|_{\mathrm{op}}.
\end{equation}
A stable coherent sector is declared only when
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon < \delta_{\mathrm{coh}},
\end{equation}
with $\delta_{\mathrm{coh}}$ fixed before evaluation. Exceeding this threshold signals representation drift and loss of projected-sector coherence.

\section{Emergent Geometry Protocol}
Geometry is reconstructed from distinguishability between projected states $\{\rho_i\}$.

First, define pairwise Bures distance:
\begin{equation}
D_B(\rho_i,\rho_j)=\sqrt{2\Big(1-\sqrt{F(\rho_i,\rho_j)}\Big)},
\end{equation}
where fidelity is
\begin{equation}
F(\rho_i,\rho_j)=\left[\operatorname{Tr}\!\left(\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho_i}\,\rho_j\,\sqrt{\rho_i}}\right)\right]^2.
\end{equation}

Second, in a local chart $\theta$, estimate an information metric by Fisher form
\begin{equation}
g_{ab}(\theta)=\sum_x p(x\mid\theta)\,\partial_a\log p(x\mid\theta)\,\partial_b\log p(x\mid\theta).
\end{equation}

Third, construct a weighted graph from $D_B$ (or local Fisher approximation), embed it, and estimate curvature from the induced metric tensor. Geometry is interpreted as an emergent descriptor of coherence organization, not a primitive axiom.

\section*{Validation and Falsification}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sweep $\kappa$ and report phase boundaries for $\delta_{\mathrm{coh}}$.
\item Replace coherence witnesses and test qualitative invariance.
\item Reject geometric conclusions if curvature signatures are unstable under mild perturbations.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
The sanitized Cosmos v5 manuscript now provides a coherent formal spine suitable for publication review: no pipeline noise, legible mathematics, and explicit failure criteria.
