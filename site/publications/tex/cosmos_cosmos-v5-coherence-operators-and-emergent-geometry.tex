Keywords cosmos, research, publication Main Content % Journal-style manuscript This paper consolidates the Cosmos v5 formal layer into a publishable baseline. We define a computable coherence functional, introduce an operator-norm compatibility criterion for projected stability, and outline a geometry reconstruction protocol from state distinguishability. The focus is methodological clarity: each equation maps to an o

\section{Methods and Evidence Basis}
bservable quantity and each interpretive claim carries an explicit falsification path. Keywords coherence operators; projection stability; emergent geometry; Bures distance; Fisher information metric Cosmos v5 studies how coherent operator structure can be tracked across projected sectors without collapsing interpretability into heuristic narrative. Earlier drafts mixed useful equations with pipeline metadata and implementation notes. This version removes non-academic artifacts and presents the formal core in a clean sequence: coherence functional, stability threshold, and geometry protocol. Let $ _{ }$ be the localized density operator in a fixed basis. We define off-diagonal coherence by ( _{ })= _{i j} | _{ij} |. Selecti on dynamics are controlled by an energy--coherence tradeoff _n = E_n - \, _n, where $ >0$ weights coherence preservation against energetic cost over recurrence windows. Let $ $ denote the projection operator onto the selected coherent sector and $ _{ }$ the local flow operator. Compatibility mismatch is = \| - _{ } \|_{ }. A stable coherent sector is declared only when < _{ }, with $ _{ }$ fixed before evaluation. Exceeding this threshold signals representation drift and loss of projected-sector coherence. Geometry is reconstructed from distinguishability between projected states $\{ _i\}$. First, define pairwise Bures distance: D_B( _i, _j)= )}, where fidel

\section{Discussion}
ity is F( _i, _j)= ^2. Second, in a local chart $ $, estimate an information metric by Fisher form g_{ab}( )= _x p(x )\, _a p(x )\, _b p(x ). Third, construct a weighted graph from $D_B$ (or local Fisher approximation), embed it, and estimate curvature from the induced metric tensor. Geometry is interpreted as an emergent descriptor of coherence organization, not a primitive axiom. Validation and Falsification Sweep $ $ and report phase boundaries for $ _{ }$. Replace coherence witnesses and test qualitative invariance. Reject geometric conclusions if curvature signatures are unstable under mild perturbations. Conclusion The sanitized Cosmos v5 manuscript now provides a coherent formal spine suitable for publication review: no pipeline noise, legible mathematics, and explicit failure criteria. Verify each key claim against primary sources before external distribution. Separate observed evidence from interpretive inference in final edits. Track confidence levels and unresolved uncertainties transparently.
