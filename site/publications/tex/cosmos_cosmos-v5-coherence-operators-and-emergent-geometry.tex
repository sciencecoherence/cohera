Converted Section 8.2 compatibility relation into a concrete norm-threshold criterion. Defined Section 8.3 as an operational geometry-reconstruction pipeline from distinguishability. 1) Coherence functional (8.1) Projected coherence is quantified with a

n explicit ( ell\_1 )-style off-diagonal measure: C(ρ loc ) = Σ i≠j |ρ ij | Selection is controlled with: F n = E n − κ C n , minimized over recurrence windows. 2) Stability threshold (8.2) Compatibility is now explicit: ε = ||ΠF − F loc Π|| op Stable coherent sector condition: ε < δ coh Interpretation: crossing (δ\_\{coh\} ) triggers representation drift and projected-sector decoherence. 3) Emergent geometry protocol (8.3) Distance from projected-state distinguishability (Bures/Fisher). Graph construction from pairwise distances. Metric tensor + curvature estimation on learned manifold.

Validation checklist Verify all nontrivial claims against the original source. Add explicit citations/DOIs where available. Mark confidence for each key claim (low/medium/high).

\section{Discussion}
Discussion and implications are being finalized for publication quality.

\section{Validation and Falsification Hooks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Verify each key claim against primary sources before external distribution.
\item Separate observed evidence from interpretive inference in final edits.
\item Track confidence levels and unresolved uncertainties transparently.
\end{itemize}
