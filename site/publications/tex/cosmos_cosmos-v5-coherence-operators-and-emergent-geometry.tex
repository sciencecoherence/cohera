Cosmos v5 · Coherence Operators and Emergent Geometry Cohera Lab Home Research Cosmos Regenesis Ethos Publications About Cosmos v5: Coherence Operators and Emergent Geometry Date: 2026-02-22 · Thread: cosmos · Confidence: medium (formal proposal level) What was completed in this cycle Converted Section 8.1 from placeholder to a computable coherence-functional proposal. Converted Section 8.2 compatibility relation into a concrete norm-threshold criterion. Defined Section 8.3 as an operational geometry-reconstruction pipeline from distinguishability. 1) Coherence functional (8.1) Projected coherence is quantified with an explicit \textbackslash{}(\textbackslash{}ell\_1\textbackslash{})-style off-diagonal measure: C(ρ loc ) = Σ i≠j |ρ ij | Selection is controlled with: F n = E n − κ C n , minimized over recurrence windows. 2) Stability threshold (8.2) Compatibility is now explicit: ε = ||ΠF − F loc Π|| op Stable coherent sector condition: ε < δ coh Interpretation: crossing \textbackslash{}(δ\_\{coh\}\textbackslash{}) triggers representation drift and projected-sector decoherence. 3) Emergent geometry protocol (8.3) Distance from projected-state distinguishability (Bures/Fisher). Graph construction from pairwise distances. Metric tensor + curvature estimation on learned manifold.
