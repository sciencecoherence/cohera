\section{Introduction}
Time Crystals, Holography, and Quantum Information: Minimal Common Ground Abstract This publication provides a structured synthesis for Time Crystals, Holography, and Quantum Information: Minimal Common Ground, with claim-to-evidence framing and a validation path for downstream readers. Keywords cosmos, research, publication Main Content % Journal-style manuscript We present a bounded synthesis linking Floquet time-crystal dynamics, holographic coarse-graining, and operator-level coherence constraints through a micro--macro isomorphism: coherence signatures used in cosmological reconstruction are paired with biological/metabolic analogs at the level of stability and dissipation control. To avoid rhetorical overreach, we anchor the framework in computable distances and information geometry (Bures-style state separation and Fisher metric structure) and treat unclosed derivations as explicit equation-shape requirements rather than claims. Falsification Hook: the model fails if coherence thresholds remain stable in one domain (cosmological or biological analog) while systematically collapsing in its mapped counterpart under matched perturbation classes, or if boundary--bulk coherence mismatch cannot be reduced below pre-registered tolerance in controlled toy regimes. Keywords time crystals; Floquet dynamics; holography; quantum information; coherence operators Time-crystal discours

\section{Methods and Evidence Basis}
e often blends distinct layers: equilibrium no-go results, non-equilibrium Floquet order, and broader information-theoretic interpretations. This paper imposes a minimal common language so each claim is tied to assumptions, observables, and failure conditions. Let $ _t$ denote a reduced state over a bounded operator algebra. We define a periodic coherence witness over one drive period $T$: _T = {T} _0^T ( _t\, _c)\,dt, where $ _c$ is a coherence-sensitive bounded observable. For perturbation family $\{ \}$, coherence drift is _{ }= | _T( )- _T(0) |. With stroboscopic map $ _T$, robust regime membership is declared only when _{ } _{ } < _*, for pre-registered tolerance $ _*$. Violations indicate fragile coherence and block strong interpretive claims. We compare boundary and reconstructed proxies using a coarse-graining channel $ $. Consistency is evaluated by | ^{ }_T- ^{ }_T | , where $ $ is reported as model error (not absorbed narratively). In local parameter chart $ $, geometry diagnostics can be approximated through Fisher information: g_{ab}( )= _x p(x )\, _a p(x )\, _b p(x ). Validation and Falsification Sweep drive-noise amplitude and detect breakdown of the stability threshold. Replace $ _c$ with orthogonal witness families to test basis sensitivity. Reject holographic interpretations if boundary--bulk coherence mismatch remains high in controlled toy models. Conclusion

\section{Discussion}
 The manuscript provides a cleaner publication baseline: assumptions are explicit, equations are legible, and interpretive claims are paired with concrete failure criteria.

\section{Validation and Falsification Hooks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Verify each key claim against primary sources before external distribution.
\item Separate observed evidence from interpretive inference in final edits.
\item Track confidence levels and unresolved uncertainties transparently.
\end{itemize}
