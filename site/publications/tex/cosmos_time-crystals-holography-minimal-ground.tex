\begin{abstract}
We present a bounded synthesis linking Floquet time-crystal dynamics, holographic coarse-graining, and operator-level coherence constraints through a micro--macro isomorphism: coherence signatures used in cosmological reconstruction are paired with biological/metabolic analogs at the level of stability and dissipation control. To avoid rhetorical overreach, we anchor the framework in computable distances and information geometry (Bures-style state separation and Fisher metric structure) and treat unclosed derivations as explicit equation-shape requirements rather than claims. \textbf{Falsification Hook:} the model fails if coherence thresholds remain stable in one domain (cosmological or biological analog) while systematically collapsing in its mapped counterpart under matched perturbation classes, or if boundary--bulk coherence mismatch cannot be reduced below pre-registered tolerance in controlled toy regimes.

\section{Introduction}
Time-crystal discourse often blends distinct layers: equilibrium no-go results, non-equilibrium Floquet order, and broader information-theoretic interpretations. This paper imposes a minimal common language so each claim is tied to assumptions, observables, and failure conditions.

\section{Coherence Functional}
Let $\rho_t$ denote a reduced state over a bounded operator algebra. We define a periodic coherence witness over one drive period $T$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}_T = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \operatorname{Tr}(\rho_t\,\mathcal{O}_c)\,dt,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{O}_c$ is a coherence-sensitive bounded observable.

For perturbation family $\{\epsilon\}$, coherence drift is
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{\epsilon}=\left|\mathcal{C}_T(\epsilon)-\mathcal{C}_T(0)\right|.
\end{equation}

\section{Stability Threshold}
With stroboscopic map $\Phi_T$, robust regime membership is declared only when
\begin{equation}
\sup_{\epsilon\in[0,\epsilon_0]}\Delta_{\epsilon} < \delta_*,
\end{equation}
for pre-registered tolerance $\delta_*$. Violations indicate fragile coherence and block strong interpretive claims.

\section{Emergent Geometry Protocol}
We compare boundary and reconstructed proxies using a coarse-graining channel $\mathcal{R}$. Consistency is evaluated by
\begin{equation}
\left|\mathcal{C}^{\partial}_T-\mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{bulk}}_T\right| \le \eta,
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is reported as model error (not absorbed narratively). In local parameter chart $\theta$, geometry diagnostics can be approximated through Fisher information:
\begin{equation}
g_{ab}(\theta)=\sum_x p(x\mid\theta)\,\partial_a\log p(x\mid\theta)\,\partial_b\log p(x\mid\theta).
\end{equation}

\section*{Validation and Falsification}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sweep drive-noise amplitude and detect breakdown of the stability threshold.
\item Replace $\mathcal{O}_c$ with orthogonal witness families to test basis sensitivity.
\item Reject holographic interpretations if boundary--bulk coherence mismatch remains high in controlled toy models.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
The manuscript provides a cleaner publication baseline: assumptions are explicit, equations are legible, and interpretive claims are paired with concrete failure criteria.
