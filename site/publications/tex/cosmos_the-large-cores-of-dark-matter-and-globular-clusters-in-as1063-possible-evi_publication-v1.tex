\section{Discussion}
ral claim sentence-by-sentence. Cross-check against at least one independent source before promotion. Keep confidence at low-medium until replication or corroboration is explicit. Next queries What is the smallest testable claim from this source?

\section{Validation Hooks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Verify central claims against primary paper and DOI source.
\item Separate measured evidence from interpretation in final revision.
\item Keep confidence conservative until corroboration is explicit.
\end{itemize}
