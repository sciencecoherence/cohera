We develop a minim Key findings (auto-extracted) Primary topic appears to center on: self, organized, bioelectricity, collective. Source was auto-indexed and text-previewed for rapid triage. Needs manual verification before promoting any strong claim to high confidence.

Claim → evidence mapping (auto) Claim: Self-Organized Bioelectricity via Collective Pump Alignment: Physical Origin of Chemiosmosis Ryosuke Nishide ∗ and Kunihiko Kaneko arXiv:2602.16171v1 [physics.bio-ph] 18 Feb 2026 N… Evidence quote: “Self-Organized Bioelectricity via Collective Pump Alignment: Physical Origin of Chemiosmosis Ryosuke Nishide ∗ and Kunihiko Kaneko arXiv:2602.16171v1 [physics.bio-ph] 18 Feb 2026 Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Jagtvej 155 A, Copenhagen N, 2200, Denmark Chemiosmosis maintains life in nonequilibrium through ion transport across membranes, yet the origin of this order remains unclear.” Page hint: 1-2 Claim: We develop a minimal model in which ion pump orientation and the intracellular electrochemical potential mutually reinforce each other. Evidence quote: “We develop a minimal model in which ion pump orientation and the intracellular electrochemical potential mutually reinforce each other.” Page hint: 1-2 Claim: This model shows that fluctuations can induce collective pump alignment and the formation of a membrane potential. Evidence quote: “This model shows that fluctuations can induce collective pump alignment and the formation of a membrane potential.” Page hint: 1-2 Falsification / validation checklist Re-read full source and verify the central claim sentence-by-sentence. Cross-check against at least one independent source before promotion. Keep confidence at low-medium until replication or corroboration is explicit. Next queries What is the smallest testable claim from this source?

\subsection*{Validation checklist}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Verify all nontrivial claims against the original source.
  \item Add explicit citations/DOIs where available.
  \item Mark confidence for each key claim (low/medium/high).
\end{itemize}
