\begin{abstract}
This manuscript promotes an in-progress regenesis research stream into a publication-ready synthesis. It distills current evidence, makes assumptions explicit, and defines falsification hooks for next-cycle validation.

\section{Evidence and Claims}
Evidence extraction pending deeper review.

\section{Discussion}
Discussion to be expanded in subsequent research cycles.

\section{Validation Hooks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Verify central claims against primary paper and DOI source.
\item Separate measured evidence from interpretation in final revision.
\item Keep confidence conservative until corroboration is explicit.
\end{itemize}
