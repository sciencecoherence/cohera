\subsection*{Abstract}
This paper presents a structured synthesis of current cosmos evidence around dark matter core structure in as1063: evidence synthesis. It consolidates the ongoing research pipeline into a publication-ready narrative with explicit validation constraints, claim-to-evidence continuity, and next-step falsification criteria.

\subsection*{Validation / Falsification Checklist}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Re-check all central claims against primary sources and DOI-linked material.
  \item Mark confidence per claim and separate inference from evidence.
  \item Require at least one independent corroborating source before final publication promotion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Operational Next Steps}
atter).” Page hint: 1-2 Falsification / validation checklist Re-read full source and verify the central claim sentence-by-sentence. Cross-check against at least one independent source before promotion. Keep confidence at low-medium until replication or corroboration is explicit.
