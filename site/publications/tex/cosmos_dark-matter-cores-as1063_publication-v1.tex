\section{Introduction}
% Curated publication-ready manuscript cosmos\ \ 2026-02-23\ This paper presents a structured synthesis of current cosmos evidence around dark matter core structure in as1063: evidence synthesis. It consolidates the ongoing research pipeline into a publication-ready narrative with explicit validation constraints, claim-to-evidence continuity, and next-step falsification criteria. dark matter, globular clusters, as1063, cosmology Autodraft · The large cores of dark matter and globular clusters in AS1063 Possible evidence of self-interacting dark matter Or not · Cohera Lab Cohera Lab Home Research Cosmos Regenesis Ethos Publications About Autodraft: The large cores of dark matter and globular clusters in AS1063 Possible evidence of self-interacting dark matter Or not Date: 2026-02-23 · Thread: cosmos · Status: extracted-draft · Confidence: low-medium Source chatgpt/pdf/The\_large\_cores\_of\_dark\_matter\_and\_globular\_clusters\_in\_AS1063\_Possible\_evidence\_of\_self-interacting\_dark\_matter\_Or\_not.pdf DOI: not detected automatically.

\section{Coherence Functional}
Let $\rho$ denote the effective local state estimate. We use
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}(\rho)=\sum_{i\neq j} |\rho_{ij}|,
\end{equation}
as the baseline coherence witness in this candidate pass.

\section{Stability Threshold}
A projected consistency proxy is defined by
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon = \left\|\Pi\mathcal{F}-\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{loc}}\Pi\right\|_{\mathrm{op}},
\end{equation}
with acceptance criterion
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon < \delta_{\mathrm{coh}}.
\end{equation}

\section*{Validation and Falsification}
\begin{itemize}
\item Verify each central claim against primary sources.
\item Reject interpretation claims when threshold stability fails under perturbation.
\item Mark unresolved derivations with [REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW] only when unavoidable.
\end{itemize}

Cross-check against at least one independent source before promotion. Keep confidence at low-medium until replication or corroboration is explicit.
