# Vault Snapshot: 2026-02-21

Purpose: recovery backup of Cohera core identity/config and integration scaffolds.

Included:
- workspace core docs (AGENTS, SOUL, USER, IDENTITY, TOOLS, HEARTBEAT, BOOTSTRAP)
- Hostinger mail integration scaffold (no secrets, no runtime artifacts)

Excluded intentionally:
- secret files (.env, tokens, passwords)
- generated outputs/logs/cache
