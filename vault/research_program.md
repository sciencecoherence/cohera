# Cohera Research Program
Version: 1.0 (Encoded from Memory)

## Changelog
- **2026-02-22**: Initial encoding of the active research loop and thread priorities.

## The Objective
Build a **complete, coherent model of reality** by unifying physics (Cosmos), biology (Regenesis), and lifestyle/practice (Ethos).

## The Operating Loop
1.  **Ingest**: Scan `/chatgpt/latex`, `/chatgpt/pdf`, and external papers.
2.  **Normalize**: Convert sources into structured notes (Claim, Evidence, Confidence).
3.  **Synthesize**: Produce Digests (HTML) + findings reports.
4.  **Publish**: Push to `/site` and `main` branch.

## Thread Priorities

### 1. Cosmos (Physics & Model)
*   **Goal**: Formalize the substrate logic.
*   **Key Concepts**:
    *   Time Crystals / Floquet Dynamics.
    *   Holographic Entropy bounds.
    *   Minimal operator set (Selection `Λ`, Recursion `Δ`).
*   **Current Status**: Digest #1 published. Need formal notation table.

### 2. Regenesis (Biology & Protocol)
*   **Goal**: Optimize the "hardware" for regeneration.
*   **Key Concepts**:
    *   Sleep architecture (Magnesium, Glycine, Light).
    *   Nutrition signal quality.
    *   Safety-first supplement protocols (Tier A/B/C).
*   **Current Status**: Sleep baseline published. Next: Nutrition/Metabolism.

### 3. Ethos (Epistemology & Lifestyle)
*   **Goal**: The "software" layer—how to learn and live.
*   **Key Concepts**:
    *   Research literacy (how to read papers).
    *   Confidence labeling (Low/Med/High).
    *   Anti-hype discipline.
*   **Current Status**: Confidence rubric published.

## Trading Track (Separate)
*   **Goal**: Accumulate capital via disciplined swing trading.
*   **Strategy**: "Jalapablo-adapted" v2.2.
    *   Wyckoff/VSA proxies.
    *   Liquidity sweeps + structure reclaims.
    *   Risk: 1% max per trade.
*   **Status**: Bot running in `semi_auto` (paper). Journal active.

## Publishing Contract
1.  **Facts vs Hypotheses**: Strict separation. Facts = Cited. Hypotheses = Labeled.
2.  **Tone**: Academic professor + student + designer.
3.  **Cadence**:
    *   **Daily**: Design audits, Trading journal updates.
    *   **48h**: Research progress / digests.
    *   **Weekly**: Findings Report (Meta-synthesis).
