# Science Coherence: Monetization & Growth Roadmap
Version: 1.0 (Draft)

## Core Philosophy
**Value First, Capture Second.**
We do not sell information (info is free). We sell **transformation** (protocols that work) and **acceleration** (tools/systems).

## Phase 1: The Trust Engine (Current)
*   **Goal:** Build authority and audience.
*   **Asset:** Free Digests (Regenesis/Cosmos/Ethos).
*   **Mechanism:** Publish high-signal content to `sciencecoherence.com`. Send email digests.
*   **Metric:** Email subscribers + Recurring visitors.
*   **Revenue:** $0 (Investment phase).

## Phase 2: The Protocol Library (Paid Product v1)
*   **Concept:** "The Engineering Manual for Your Body."
*   **Product:** A structured, notion-like or web-app dashboard with exact protocols.
    *   *Sleep Stack* (validated).
    *   *Gut Reset* (validated).
    *   *Focus/Dopamine Detox* (validated).
*   **Format:** One-time purchase ($50-$150) or Annual Membership ($99/yr).
*   **Why it sells:** People are tired of random health tips. They want a **system**.

## Phase 3: The Coherence Community (Network Effects)
*   **Concept:** "The Lab."
*   **Product:** Private Discord/Circle for people actively running the protocols.
*   **Value:** Q&A with you (Xavier), peer data sharing ("N=1" experiments), early access to research.
*   **Price:** Monthly sub ($20-$50/mo).

## Phase 4: The Physics AI (The Moonshot)
*   **Concept:** "Cohera Prime."
*   **Product:** A specialized AI fine-tuned on the *Cosmos* physics model and *Regenesis* biology data.
*   **Utility:** It doesn't just chat; it *models* problems using your geometric/holographic framework.
*   **Funding:** Powered by Phase 2 & 3 revenue.

## Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1.  **Refine the "Sleep Protocol"**: Turn the current blog post into a downloadable PDF checklist (Lead Magnet).
2.  **Add Email Capture**: Put a clean "Join the Lab" email form on the site home page.
3.  **Validate**: See if people actually download the checklist. If yes, build the full Protocol product.
